# Water-Tank-Control-

Usually when a water tank overflows the water then we should turn off water tank machine switch. Again, when it underflows the water we need to turn on the machine switch. Here, we create an artificial agent which task is, control the machine switch. It uses two sensors in the water tank and they give some value to the agent. An agent takes a decision on those values; Turn on the switch or off. No need help from outside to observe the agent task cause an agent cannot make mistake if its designer not mistake.
