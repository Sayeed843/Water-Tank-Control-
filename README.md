# Water-Tank-Control-

Nowadays, people have used the prepaid system in electricity power supply. So, people are aware of the reduction in electricity wastage. In my project, I am trying to include water division at this stage. Every user will be able to buy a certain quantity of water for each month. After the water is over, he will be able to buy water through recharge in his account. An artificial agent will give his dignified intelligence to determine the amount of water. The user will take a benefit from this system. Their water tank will automatically fill up when system agent would realize that the water is going to end a short time. The user will get a rest from control the mechanical switch.
